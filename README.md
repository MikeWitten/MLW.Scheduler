# MLW.Scheduler
WGU C195

This JavaFX application is meant to be a stand alone desktop application.  It uses an SQL database, implements a single sign on security feature, adjusts timezones automatically and coordinates appointments in UDT.  The program features a limited implementation of internationalization to French which can be seen on the sign on screens and in the alert dialogs upon signing into the home screen. 

WGU Current Students:
Please ensure that you are not using this information improperly, as of August 2022 the use of other peoples github projects was not allowed.  If you are using this project in good faith and in accordance with the current rules please take note. 
Since it was originally submitted some changes have been made to meet University requirements.  The model was changed to include objects with inheritance, Reports were changed to include full table information, and some minor changes were made to show polymorphism in the inherited objects (specifically, the appointment types).
I have added notes to each section of the project to explain my logic and hopefully allow you to consider, laugh at, or vomit over my approach.  Feel free to reach out with any questions as I am more than happy to learn from you and share whatever non-sensical knowledge I have learned from youtubers and my own foolish errors in the building of this monstrosity.
